# Objective

- As summarised in the description this game is a platformer however, we have incorporated a little twist. You are not platforming alone, just a few seconds behind you is a ghost, a monster if you will, shadowing you taking the same path you did. The minor difference is, that it ignores any unnecessary movements.
- Your objective is to uncover the secred burried deep on the military base. You need special glasses to see the special door of the `Sector D`, however those glasses have been broken thus it forces you to search the remaining 3 Sectors for their `Shards`.
